# 1
-- Use the NTILE functionality to divide the accounts into 4 levels in terms of the amount of standard_qty for their orders.
-- Your resulting table should have
--      the account_id,
--      the occurred_at time for each order,
--      the total amount of standard_qty paper purchased,
--      and one of four levels in a standard_quartile column.

-- The course solution used partition by account_id, but that doesn't really make sense, because we are not
-- grouping by account.

select account_id, occurred_at, standard_qty, ntile(4) over (order by standard_qty) as standard_quartile
from orders
order by standard_quartile desc


# 2
-- Use the NTILE functionality to divide the accounts into two levels in terms of the amount of gloss_qty for their orders.
-- Your resulting table should have
--      the account_id,
--      the occurred_at time for each order,
--      the total amount of gloss_qty paper purchased,
--      and one of two levels in a gloss_half column.

-- The course solution used partition by account_id, but that doesn't really make sense, because we are not
-- grouping by account.

select account_id, occurred_at, gloss_qty, ntile(2) over ( order by gloss_qty) as gloss_half
from orders
order by gloss_half desc


# 3
-- Use the NTILE functionality to divide the orders for each account into 100 levels in terms of the amount
-- of total_amt_usd for their orders.
-- Your resulting table should have
--      the account_id,
--      the occurred_at time for each order,
--      the total amount of total_amt_usd paper purchased,
--      and one of 100 levels in a total_percentile column.

-- The course solution used partition by account_id, but that doesn't really make sense, because we are not
-- grouping by account.

select account_id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd, ntile(100) over (order by total_amt_usd) as total_percentile
from orders
order by total_percentile desc
