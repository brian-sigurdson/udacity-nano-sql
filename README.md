# Udacity SQL Nanodegree
Coursework for the Udacity SQL Nanodegree.  The course had two projects that are described below.
1. Deforestation Exploration - Given tables related to forestation and total land data for countries from 1990 through 2016, create a view to answer questions about forestation changes during this period, and provide answer to questions in a written report.
   * [Deforestation_Exploration_Solution.pdf](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/tree/main/0_intro_to_sql/project/Deforestation_Exploration_Solution.pdf)
     * [Create View SQL](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/0_intro_to_sql/project/create_forestation_view.sql)
     * [Global Outlook SQL](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/0_intro_to_sql/project/global_situation.sql)
     * [Regional Outlook SQL](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/0_intro_to_sql/project/regional_outlook.sql)
     * [Country Level SQL](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/0_intro_to_sql/project/country_level_detail.sql)
     * [Recommendations SQL](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/0_intro_to_sql/project/recommendations.sql)
2. Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator - Given poorly designed database tables, create a new normalized and effective schema, and migrate the data to the new schema.
   * [Udiddit_a_social_news_aggregator.pdf](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/tree/main/1_mgmt_rdbms_nosql/project/Udiddit_a_social_news_aggregator.pdf)
     * [New Schema](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/1_mgmt_rdbms_nosql/project/udiddit_ddl.sql)
     * [Migrate Data](https://github.com/brian-sigurdson/udacity-nano-sql/blob/main/1_mgmt_rdbms_nosql/project/udiddit_migration.sql)

The database used in the course was Postgresql 9.5.
